# Homelab IT Infrastructure with VMware, pfSense, Windows Server, and Microsoft Services

## Overview

This project outlines the creation of a homelab environment to simulate a real-world IT infrastructure for learning, testing, and experimentation. The setup includes network management, Windows Server deployment, email configuration with Exchange Server, custom domain integration with Office 365, and plans for Active Directory synchronization with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).

This project is designed for IT professionals and enthusiasts seeking hands-on experience in managing enterprise-grade systems.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a virtualized environment to test and explore IT infrastructure concepts.
- Learn to configure and manage networking, domain services, and email systems.
- Integrate on-premises infrastructure with cloud services for hybrid identity management.
- Practice skills in system administration, networking, and cloud integration.

---

## Features and Completed Tasks

### 1. **Network Infrastructure**
- Installed **pfSense** on VMware Workstation to manage network traffic and routing.
- Configured:
  - **WAN Network**: Acts as the external-facing connection.
  - **LAN (prod) Network**: Internal network for hosting all Windows virtual machines.
- Ensured secure communication between the virtual machines and external services.

### 2. **Windows Server 2019 Deployment**
- Installed **Windows Server 2019** as the primary server.
- Promoted the server to a **Domain Controller** for the domain `vegas-IT.local`.
- Configured Active Directory (AD) services to manage domain users, computers, and policies.

### 3. **Exchange Server 2019 Setup**
- Deployed **Exchange Server 2019** on a separate Windows Server 2019 VM.
- Configured the email system for internal and external communication.
- Ensured integration with the domain for seamless user management.

### 4. **Office 365 and Custom Domain Integration**
- Set up an **Office 365 E3 subscription** and added the custom domain `vegas-it.com`, hosted on **AWS Route 53**.
- Updated DNS records in Route 53 to:
  - Verify domain ownership.
  - Enable mail flow and other Office 365 services.
- Created multiple user accounts with the custom domain for testing email and collaboration tools.

### 5. **Integration with Microsoft Entra ID (Planned)**

- Plan to integrate the on-premises Active Directory with **Microsoft Entra ID** using **Azure Entra Connect**.
- The integration will enable:
  - **Hybrid Identity Management**: Synchronizing users and groups between on-premises AD and Entra ID.
  - **Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Providing users with streamlined access to both on-premises and cloud resources.
  - **Password Hash Synchronization**: Ensuring users can log in with the same credentials across environments.
  - **Federation with Office 365**: Facilitating secure and seamless user access to Microsoft 365 applications.
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhancing security by enforcing MFA policies for cloud applications.

#### Steps for Integration:
1. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Verify the on-premises Active Directory (vegas-it.local) is healthy and free of replication errors.
   - Ensure the domain **vegas-it.com** is verified in Microsoft Entra ID.
   - Create and configure a dedicated service account in the local AD for Azure Entra Connect.
   - Open necessary firewall ports for Azure Entra Connect to communicate with Microsoft Entra ID.

2. **Install Azure Entra Connect**:
   - Download the latest version of Azure Entra Connect from Microsoftâ€™s official site.
   - Install it on a server that is joined to the vegas-it.local domain and meets the prerequisites.

3. **Configure Azure Entra Connect**:
   - Select the **Custom Installation** option for advanced configuration.
   - Choose the **Password Hash Synchronization** or **Pass-Through Authentication** method.
   - Specify the service account created earlier for synchronization.
   - Define the Organizational Units (OUs) to sync, including users and groups.

4. **Verify Synchronization**:
   - Check the initial synchronization logs to ensure all objects (users, groups) are synced successfully to the azure domain (vegas-it.com).
   - Use the Microsoft Entra admin center to confirm that the synced accounts are appearing correctly.

# Error: Cannot Proceed Because the Sync Service Isn't Running

This document addresses the error encountered when the synchronization process between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) fails due to the **ADSync service** not running. Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

## **Error Message**
```
Cannot proceed because the sync service isn't running. Start the ADSync service and restart Azure AD Connect.
```

---

## **Steps to Resolve**

### **1. Verify the ADSync Service Status**
1. Open the **Services** console:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and press Enter.
2. Locate the service named **Microsoft Azure AD Sync**.
3. Check the status:
   - If the service is **stopped**, right-click it and select **Start**.
   - If the service fails to start, proceed to Step 5 to troubleshoot further.

---

### **2. Restart the Azure AD Connect Tool**
1. Open **Azure AD Connect** from the Start menu.
2. Choose the **Synchronize Now** option to trigger a manual synchronization once the service is running.

---
### **3. Check Event Viewer Logs**
1. Open **Event Viewer**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `eventvwr`, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to the following sections:
   - **Windows Logs > Application**
   - **Windows Logs > System**
3. Look for errors related to **ADSync** or **Azure AD Connect** to identify the root cause of the issue.

---

### **4. Verify Database Connectivity**
The ADSync service uses a local SQL database to function.
1. Ensure the SQL Server (LocalDB) instance used by ADSync is running:
   - Look for services like `MSSQL$MICROSOFT##SSEE` or similar in the **Services** console.
2. If this SQL service is stopped, start it and retry starting the ADSync service.

---

### **5. Reconfigure Azure AD Connect**
If the issue persists:
1. Open **Azure AD Connect**.
2. Rerun the configuration wizard.
3. Validate the credentials for the service account used by Azure AD Connect.

---

### **6. Restart the Server**
As a last resort:
1. Restart the server hosting Azure AD Connect.
2. After rebooting, check the status of the ADSync service and retry the synchronization.

---

## **Common Causes**
- **Service Account Issues**: The account used by Azure AD Connect might have invalid credentials.
- **Database Corruption**: The SQL database used by ADSync may be corrupt or inaccessible.
- **Software Updates**: Recent updates may have disrupted the service.
- **Insufficient Resources**: The server might lack the necessary resources to run the service.

---

## **Event Viewer Log Example**
```
Event ID: 528
Source: ADSync
Description: The Microsoft Azure AD Sync service could not start due to insufficient permissions.
```
