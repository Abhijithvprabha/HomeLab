# Homelab IT Infrastructure with VMware, pfSense, Windows Server, and Microsoft Services

## Overview

This project outlines the creation of a homelab environment to simulate a real-world IT infrastructure for learning, testing, and experimentation. The setup includes network management, Windows Server deployment, email configuration with Exchange Server, custom domain integration with Office 365, and plans for Active Directory synchronization with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).

This project is designed for IT professionals and enthusiasts seeking hands-on experience in managing enterprise-grade systems.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a virtualized environment to test and explore IT infrastructure concepts.
- Learn to configure and manage networking, domain services, and email systems.
- Integrate on-premises infrastructure with cloud services for hybrid identity management.
- Practice skills in system administration, networking, and cloud integration.

## Features and Completed Tasks

### 1. **Network Infrastructure**
- Installed **pfSense** on VMware Workstation to manage network traffic and routing.
- Configured:
  - **WAN Network**: Acts as the external-facing connection.
  - **LAN (prod) Network**: Internal network for hosting all Windows virtual machines.
- Ensured secure communication between the virtual machines and external services.

### 2. **Windows Server 2019 Deployment**
- Installed **Windows Server 2019** as the primary server.
- Promoted the server to a **Domain Controller** for the domain `vegas-IT.local`.
- Configured Active Directory (AD) services to manage domain users, computers, and policies.

### 3. **Exchange Server 2019 Setup**
- Deployed **Exchange Server 2019** on a separate Windows Server 2019 VM.
- Configured the email system for internal and external communication.
- Ensured integration with the domain for seamless user management.

### 4. **Office 365 and Custom Domain Integration**
- Set up an **Office 365 E3 subscription** and added the custom domain `vegas-it.com`, hosted on **AWS Route 53**.
- Updated DNS records in Route 53 to:
  - Verify domain ownership.
  - Enable mail flow and other Office 365 services.
- Created multiple user accounts with the custom domain for testing email and collaboration tools.

### 5. **Integration with Microsoft Entra ID (Planned)**

- Plan to integrate the on-premises Active Directory with **Microsoft Entra ID** using **Azure Entra Connect**.
- The integration will enable:
  - **Hybrid Identity Management**: Synchronizing users and groups between on-premises AD and Entra ID.
  - **Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Providing users with streamlined access to both on-premises and cloud resources.
  - **Password Hash Synchronization**: Ensuring users can log in with the same credentials across environments.
  - **Federation with Office 365**: Facilitating secure and seamless user access to Microsoft 365 applications.
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhancing security by enforcing MFA policies for cloud applications.

#### Steps for Integration:
1. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Verify the on-premises Active Directory (vegas-it.local) is healthy and free of replication errors.
   - Ensure the domain **vegas-it.com** is verified in Microsoft Entra ID.
   - Create and configure a dedicated service account in the local AD for Azure Entra Connect.
   - Open necessary firewall ports for Azure Entra Connect to communicate with Microsoft Entra ID.

2. **Install Azure Entra Connect**:
   - Download the latest version of Azure Entra Connect from Microsoftâ€™s official site.
   - Install it on a server that is joined to the vegas-it.local domain and meets the prerequisites.

3. **Configure Azure Entra Connect**:
   - Select the **Custom Installation** option for advanced configuration.
   - Choose the **Password Hash Synchronization** or **Pass-Through Authentication** method.
   - Specify the service account created earlier for synchronization.
   - Define the Organizational Units (OUs) to sync, including users and groups.

4. **Verify Synchronization**:
   - Check the initial synchronization logs to ensure all objects (users, groups) are synced successfully to the azure domain (vegas-it.com).
   - Use the Microsoft Entra admin center to confirm that the synced accounts are appearing correctly.

5. **Enable Hybrid Features**:
   - Set up Seamless Single Sign-On by enabling the feature in Azure Entra Connect and configuring it in the local AD.
   - Test SSO by logging in with a synchronized user account.

6. **Enhance Security**:
   - Configure **Conditional Access Policies** to require MFA for specific applications or users.
   - Enable **Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)** for synced users.

7. **Test and Monitor**:
   - Test authentication for both cloud and on-premises applications.
   - Use Azure Entra Connect Health for monitoring synchronization status and addressing potential issues.

8. **Documentation and Maintenance**:
   - Document the setup process and configurations for future reference.
   - Schedule periodic reviews to ensure synchronization remains functional and up to date.

#### Future Goals:
- Explore **Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)** for users.
- Integrate other SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID for centralized identity management.
- Automate provisioning and deprovisioning workflows using Entra ID features.


## Future Enhancements

1. **Hybrid Identity Setup**
   - Configure and test synchronization between on-premises AD and Entra ID.
   - Set up password writeback and self-service password reset.

2. **Advanced Email Features**
   - Configure hybrid mail flow between Exchange Server and Office 365.
   - Test and validate email archiving and retention policies.

3. **Automation**
   - Use PowerShell scripts to automate tasks such as user provisioning, group creation, and domain management.
   - Explore tools like **Ansible** for infrastructure automation.

4. **Device Management**
   - Integrate **Microsoft Intune** for device management and compliance policies.

5. **Monitoring and Security**
   - Set up monitoring tools for system performance and network traffic.
   - Implement security best practices such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and regular patch management.

6. **Documentation**
   - Include step-by-step guides for each configuration.
   - Add diagrams illustrating network and system architecture.

## How to Use

Detailed instructions, configurations, and scripts will be provided in this repository. The goal is to enable others to replicate the setup in their own environments for hands-on learning.
